WP Multisite Request Membership
===============================

This [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) plugin adds a widget allowing current users to add themselves to a sub-site.  Sub-site admins can either allow users to auto-add themselves or request membership.

This is a multisite-only plugin.


How to use?
- 
* Download, install and activate this plugin.
    * You can either network-activate the plugin or activate it on selected, individual sites.
* Login to the WP admin dashboard and navigate to the "Settings > Request Membership" and set the desired settings you want.
    * If "Auto-join" is disabled, a new admin page is available under "Users > Pending Requests" to approve or decline new requests.
* Lastly, add the widget to your site by navigating to "Appearance > Widgets".  The widget is called "Request Membership".
    * The widget looks differently if a user is logged in or out.
    * If the user is logged out, a login form is shown.
    * If the user is logged in and "Auto-join" is enabled, a button is shown.
